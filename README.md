15% of sales revenue goes to the project fund for operational purposes.
35% enters the token fund pool, with 50% of that going to the current prize pool for distribution to winning users.
Shareholder Benefits:
Entitlement to dividends from the project's overall profits.
Dividends from transaction slippage.
Dividends from large prize tax revenue.
